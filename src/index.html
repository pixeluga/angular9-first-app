                <p>Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build apps for
                    any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.</p>

                <h1>SPEED & PERFORMANCE</h1>
                <p>Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web Workers
                    and server-side rendering.

                    Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data models on
                    RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.</p>

                <h1>INCREDIBLE TOOLING</h1>
                <p>Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with your own
                    components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and
                    feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus on building
                    amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>
